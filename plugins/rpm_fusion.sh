# Fedora Post-Installation Utility Script                                             #
# This script facilitates the installation and configuration of various applications  #
# and settings on a Fedora system. It includes functions to manage system updates,    #
# install essential software, and configure system settings.                          #
#                                                                                     #
# Functions:                                                                          #
#   - install_rpm_fusion: Installs RPM Fusion repositories for additional software.   #
#     This function adds both free and non-free RPM Fusion repositories, and installs #
#     necessary appstream data and tainted releases.                                  #
#                                                                                     #
# Usage:                                                                              #
#   This script is designed to be run as a plugin module as part of the Fedora        #
#   Post-Installation Script. It does not need to be executed separately.             #
# Prerequisites:                                                                      #
#   - The script assumes a Fedora system with DNF package manager installed.          #
#   - Internet connection is required for downloading packages and updates.           #

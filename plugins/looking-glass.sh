# Fedora Post-Installation Script                                                     #
# This script automates the configuration and installation of the Looking Glass client #
# on a Fedora system. It includes functions for downloading, building, and installing #
# Looking Glass, as well as setting up necessary system configurations such as SELinux #
# permissions and a systemd service for managing shared memory.                       #
#                                                                                     #
# Functions:                                                                          #
#   - setup_looking_glass_version: Prompts the user to select a version of Looking    #
#                                  Glass and downloads the selected version.          #
#   - build_and_install_looking_glass: Builds and installs the Looking Glass client.  #
#   - create_looking_glass_service: Creates a systemd service to manage shared memory #
#                                   permissions for Looking Glass.                    #
#   - set_selinux_permissions: Configures SELinux permissions for Looking Glass.      #
#   - cleanup_looking_glass: Cleans up temporary files and directories after          #
#                            installation.                                            #
#                                                                                     #
# Usage:                                                                              #
#   This script is designed to be run as part of a Fedora post-installation process.  #
#   It does not need to be executed separately.                                       #
# Prerequisites:                                                                      #
#   - The script assumes a Fedora system with root privileges.                        #
#   - Internet connection is required for downloading files and packages.             #
#   - Additional dependencies may be required for Looking Glass installation.         #
